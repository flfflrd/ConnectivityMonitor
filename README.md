#Connectivity Monitor

This script connects to a local and remote address to help determine the source of network latency.
The resulting time in milliseconds from a ping command is used to make an average over time
This is no different to the ping command itself but this program will be expanded upon to include various diagnostic features

[x] Separate ping outputs into variables
[x] Rewrite previous output
[] Report on connectivity failures
[] Log discrepancies to a file for future review
